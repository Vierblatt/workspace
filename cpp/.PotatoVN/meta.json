His personal life, by contrast, is nothing to write home about. It goes back 10 years to a formative experience that he's never quite recovered from. Sometimes your friends can be your worst enemies...at least that's what James took away from that jarring event.\n\nSo he poured himself into his work and did what he does best, soaring to stratospheric heights in his 9-to-5 at a local software company. He excels, but cannot shake the nagging thought that there is something missing from his life. He's a loner, and any friends he has these days are either at work, or of the online variety.\n\nBut that's about to change. A chance encounter while attending a work function sends James down a dizzying new path he'd never thought possible. It all comes to a head when James embarks on his own, personal City Park Play Date.\n\n[From [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/3002920/]Steam[/url]]","IsLock":false},"Developer":{"Value":"Doc62 Productions","IsLock":false},"LastPlay":{"Value":"——","IsLock":false},"ExpectedPlayTime":{"Value":"——","IsLock":false},"Rating":{"Value":0.0,"IsLock":false},"ReleaseDate":{"Value":"2024-08-16T00:00:00","IsLock":false},"SavePosition":"本地","ExePath":"..\\","Tags":{"Value":["Realistic-looking 3D","Pre-rendered 3D Graphics","Male Protagonist","ADV","Protagonist with a Face","Cunnilingus","Heroine with Big Breasts","Single Blowjob","Colored Name-tags","Cowgirl","Kinetic Novel","Adult Protagonist","Only a Single Heroine","Only Adult Heroines"],"IsLock":false},"TotalPlayTime":0,"RunAsAdmin":false,"PlayType":0,"Comment":"","MyRate":0,"PrivateComment":false}
